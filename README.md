DeforaOS Project
================

This Git repository was generated from DeforaOS' CVS tree as of Thursday,
October 18th 2012, around 17:30 CEST. From that moment on, all development
activity was switched to the Git conversion, instead of CVS.

The DeforaOS Project was subsequently restructured as follows:

* the main repository, DeforaOS.git, is owned by the "DeforaOS" organization
  and pursuing development at https://git.defora.org/, with a mirror on GitHub
  found at https://github.com/DeforaOS/DeforaOS.git;
* each sub-project is developed within its own repository;
* the former structure is kept, and refers to the respective sub-projects
  accordingly.

As always: help, advice, support, and feedback are much appreciated!

Cheers,
