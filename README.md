DeforaOS Project
================

This github repository was generated from DeforaOS' CVS tree as of
Thursday 18th 2012, around 17:30 CEST. The basic idea is to try to
commit to this repository instead of CVS from now on. This was not
exactly planned, so I apologize for the lack of structure around.

Structuring should happen gradually, and it is currently expected that:
* this repository will be owned by the "DeforaOS" organization;
* each sub-project will get its own repository;
* the current structure will be kept, and refer to the respective
  sub-projects accordingly.

Any help, advice, feedback will be much appreciated!

Cheers,
