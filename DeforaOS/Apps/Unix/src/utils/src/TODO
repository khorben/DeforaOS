all:
- improve command line arguments fetching? (inspired from wc?)
- factorize code (either need to improve configure or include a .c file)

id:
- write more readable code
- check if it's complete

kill:
- get signal number from its name

ls:
- race condition between looking if is a directory and opendir()? (check cksum too)
- segmentation fault on netbsd/sparc on long listings

rm:
- check for symlinks in recursive removal?
