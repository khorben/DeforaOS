Makepasswd generates (pseudo-)random passwords of a desired length.
It is able to generate its crypted equivalent.


Newest versions can be found at:

It just needs GCC, make and your glibc headers to compile (I'm using linux, glibc 2.2.5 and gcc 3.2.1).

As the program now uses the GNU libc "crypt()" call, it may not compile anymore on non-GNU systems. Feedback about this would be greatly appreciated.


Feel free to send comments, suggestions to the author (see the AUTHORS file).
