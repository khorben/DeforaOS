GPuTTY installation notes
-------------------------


To install GPuTTY in /usr/local, just proceed this way:
$ make
[compiles and generates a whole lot of warnings]
$ make install

To install it in another path, use the DESTDIR variable:
$ make install DESTDIR=<destination_path>

If you want to remove debugging symbols and silly warnings, add the following option (don't forget to complete a "make clean" before if some files have already been compiled):
$ make CFLAGS="-O2 -D_GNU_SOURCE"
