GPuTTY 0.9.8 release notes
--------------------------


GPuTTY remembers and launches SSH sessions, using existing ssh and terminal emulator programs.


GPuTTY is Copyright (c) 2004 Pierre Pronchery
It is shipped under the terms of the GPL license, which you may read in the COPYING file also contained in this archive.


Please read the INSTALL file for instructions about how to compile and install GPuTTY.


By default GPuTTY uses "ssh" as its ssh program, and "xterm" as its terminal emulator. You may change this system-wide in a /etc/gputty file:
ssh=ssh
xterm=xterm

or in your ~/.gputty file, the same way.

Please read the BUGS file for information about known problems, and planned feature upgrades.


Thanks for using this small program. I hope it will be useful.
