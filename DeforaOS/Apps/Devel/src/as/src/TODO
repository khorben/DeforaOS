- correct the grammar errors (spaces at end of operands)
- in filesystem hierarchy:
  * /Apps/Devel/Binaries/as (packaged as bin.<arch>)    => binary
  * /Apps/Devel/Libraries/libas.{so,a} (same as for bin) => library
  * /Apps/Devel/Libraries/as/*                           => plug-ins
  * /Apps/Devel/as/*    => cross-platform specific files (Shared/as instead?)
  * /Apps/Devel/Shared/* => cross-platform shared files
  and also:
  * %s/etc/Config/ ?
- format plug-in detection?
- think about configuration files:
  * override architecture and format default detection
  * could ship different ones according to architecture (eg k7 => i686 if not implemented)
- IA32 opcodes may have a prefix, R/M, SIB
- output is not byte-swapped if necessary
