- correct the grammar errors (spaces at end of operands)
- in filesystem hierarchy:
  * /Apps/Devel/bin/as (packaged as bin.<arch>)    => binary
  * /Apps/Devel/lib/libas.{so,a} (same as for bin) => library
  * /Apps/Devel/lib/as/*                           => plug-ins
  * /Apps/Devel/as/*    => cross-platform specific files (share/as instead?)
  * /Apps/Devel/share/* => cross-platform shared files
  and also:
  * %s/bin/Binaries/ ?
  * %s/lib/Libraries/ ?
  * %s/share/Shared/ ?
  * %s/etc/Config/ ?
- format plug-in detection?
- think about configuration files:
  * override architecture and format default detection
  * could ship different ones according to architecture (eg k7 => i686 if not implemented)
