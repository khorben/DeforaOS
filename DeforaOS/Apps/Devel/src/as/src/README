- GAS uses the same syntax as section naming for its directives
- a.out only supports a few pre-defined sections, some other formats (at least XCOFF and ELF apparently) support arbitrary names for sections...
- ...which doesn't make sense because having directives using the same syntax doesn't allow sections named like existing directives
- maybe add a "directive" element, starting with a "#" instead of a "."?
- later on, handle /* */ comments instead (and maybe exclusively)
- later on, handle comments and directives from a preprocessor, which code would be shared with at least C and C++ then \o/

- CC will provide a framework for other compiled languages (TEST_EQUAL, AFFECT, ...)
- AS will provide a framework for CC (architecture level operations)
