Quick guide to DaPortal 2
=========================

About DaPortal 2
----------------

DaPortal 2 is a Content Management System (CMS) written in the PHP programming
language. Although PHP is primarily oriented as a language and environment for
web-based applications, it can also be used directly from the command line, or
while building rich applications on the desktop. DaPortal also supports some of
these additional possibilities.

Likewise, DaPortal 2 does not depend on a specific database backend in
particular. It will often require a SQL server though.

The homepage of DaPortal 2 can be found here, together with downloadable release
