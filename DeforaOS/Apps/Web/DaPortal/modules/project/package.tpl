<h1 class="title package">Project packages</h1>
<p>
Sorry, software packages are not available yet. There will be some as soon as
components will reach the <a href="roadmap.php"
title="DeforaOS roadmap">targeted versions</a>. However, the package format is
not even designed yet.
</p>
<p>
The DeforaOS codebase is developped with portability in mind, to the extent of
the <a href="policy.php" title="DeforaOS development policy">development
policies</a> in place: you can safely expect some parts of the project to be
available for other systems too. They will certainly be offered as <a
href="index.php?module=category&amp;id=264"
title="DeforaOS source code releases">source code archives</a>, their inclusion
(if ever) in other open source systems will be encouraged, within the conditions
of respective license terms. In the latter case, we will be happy to list the
supported systems here.
