Sorry, software packages are not available yet. There will be some as soon as components will reach the targeted versions. However, the package format is not even designed yet.

The DeforaOS codebase is developped with portability in mind, to the extent of the development policies in place: you can safely expect some parts of the system to be available for other systems too. They will certainly be offered as source code archives, their inclusion (if ever) in other open source systems will be encouraged, within the conditions of their respective license terms. In the latter case, we will be happy to list the supporting systems here.
