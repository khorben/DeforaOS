<h3>State of the project</h3>
<p>
The DeforaOS project is currently looking for feedback about the in-progress documentation, particularly the <a href="/docs/DOSPR/">project reference</a>.
</p>
<p>
The only mature source code available is an ongoing implementation of a POSIX-compliant environment. This is for many reasons:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>wish to provide this environment in DeforaOS;</li>
	<li>need to grasp the necessary parts of the system, through a proven one;</li>
	<li>availability of supported utilities for the early development steps;</li>

	<li>personal desire to create my own portable and coherent development environment for the project;</li>
	<li>learn OS-related C system development through practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Consequently, the <a href="index.php?module=project&action=download">download</a> section is currently limited to the browsing of this source code. Some really early code is (or soon will be) also available, including the libSystem and a really basic bootloader.
