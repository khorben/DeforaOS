A few notes about the current installation process:

* PHP magic quotes must be enabled for GET and POST (they should be checked at
  run-time and "work-arounded" and necessary but this is not implemented)
* "short_open_tags" is not necessary anymore
* keep the source code in a separate directory
* move the "css", "icons", "images", "js" and "themes" directory in the desired
  web server directory
* create symbolic links to the folders moved above
* initialize your database with either "install/postgresql.sql",
  "install/mysql.sql" or "install/sqlite.sql" as necessary
* at this point you may wish to change the default login and password (table
  "daportal_user" username and MD5 hash of the password)
* edit "config.php" accordingly
* create an "index.php" file there with the following content:

<?php if(chdir('/path/to/daportal')) require('./engine.php'); ?>

At this point if everything went well you should be able to login as specified
on the page "index.php?module=user", or otherwise with the default "admin"
account with the password "password".

To assist you in the debugging process don't forget to check your Apache error
logs. You can also force debugging output in DaPortal itself in "config.php" by
uncommenting the line:

//$debug = 1;
