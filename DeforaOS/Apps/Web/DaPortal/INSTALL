IMPORTANT
---------
Since I've been writing these notes, I've implemented the administration interface for the layout pages. It requires the server to have full write access on the "pages" subfolder. It's the only one that requires this.


USER-FRIENDLY SETUP
-------------------
If you want to give a try to what should be the easiest way to install DaPortal, follow these instructions. If you like to do things manually, or if you have a problem here (doh!), please try the manual configuration below.

Install DaPortal files in your web server documents tree as desired. Though this is bad practice, your web server should be allowed to modify "index.php", and write to "config.php", to apply your settings. As a security measure, the next step has to be done talking directly to the server, using the 127.0.0.1 IP for instance. Get your web browser to the index.php file: you should see a basic web form, asking for your database settings.

Please note that if the connection is successful, the basic DaPortal SQL tables will be reinitialized. Then your index.php and config.php files will be updated, and your next access to the site should point you to the default page. You are then advised to lock the permissions on DaPortal files.


MANUAL SETUP
------------
The setup for the SQL server connectivity is done in the config.php file. By default it is created like this:
<?php



//check url
if(eregi("config.php", $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']))
{
	header("Location: index.php");
	exit(0);
}

$dbtype = "pgsql";
$dbhost = "dbhostname";
$dbport = "";
$dbname = "dbname";
$dbuser = "dbusername";
$dbpassword = "dbpassword";


?>
Replace values according to your SQL server settings.

The next thing to do is to point index.php to the engine.php file. To do so, open it and replace the following line:
include("install.php");
with this one:
include("engine.php");

At this stage the database is already filled with default values, and an administration account. Its default username/password pair is admin/password. To install more modules, like the "news" one, a system has been implemented, though there isn't any way to activate it yet. I'll finish this as soon as I can, if you want to try by yourself, give it an entry in the "daportal_modules" table, then read the "modules/<module_name>/module.php" file, its "<module_name>_install()" PHP function contains the necessary steps.

Thanks.
