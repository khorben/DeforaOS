This software is Copyright (c) 2005 Pierre Pronchery.
It has been developped in my own time, and inspired from projects developped at
FPconcept, with their permission.


Please read the BUGS file for detailed information about the project caveats and
orientations. Please read the INSTALL file for information about how to install
this software.


I want to thank FPconcept for their support. FPconcept is a small IT company
based in France, developping web-based solutions and installing wireless
infrastructures on-demand. They currently hire me sandwich-time as an intern, as
required for my scholarship at INSIA, a computer engineering school located in
Paris, France.
