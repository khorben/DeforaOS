PHP Explorer known bugs
-----------------------


There are no known bugs up to this date. However, it is absolutely critical to
know and understand the following:
- this project is alpha software;
- this project may reveal critical information to the user.

Consequently, do not allow access to this software to anyone you may not trust.


The following list of features are planned:
- improve the javascript tree collapsing function (it currently parses the whole
  sub-tree to hide the adequate folders, which is everything but optimal);
- detect the browsers capacities as a file viewer, to allow direct visualization
  of the adequate files;
- allow files deletion, renaming and upload;
- find a way to securely run the Explorer with different UIDs, with suExec for
  instance;
- work on file/mime/icon associations (with freedesktop compliance in mind);
- reverse sort order in detailed view;
- themable icons;
- remember users' default view;
- test filesystems and web server charsets;

and as this is free software, potentially anything that may come to one's mind.

Please bug khorben@defora.org for any idea or suggestion.
