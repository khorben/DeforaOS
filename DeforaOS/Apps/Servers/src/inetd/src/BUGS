- move parser.c to config.c (_config_parse())
- UDP is unsupported, here's what's said about it in netkit's inetd:
 * Datagram oriented services are invoked when a datagram
 * arrives; a process is created and passed a pending message
 * on file descriptor 0.  Datagram servers may either connect
 * to their peer, freeing up the original socket for inetd
 * to receive further messages on, or ``take over the socket'',
 * processing all arriving datagrams and, eventually, timing
 * out.  The first type of server is said to be ``multi-threaded'';
 * the second type of server ``single-threaded''.
